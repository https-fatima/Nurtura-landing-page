——Project Evolution——
Technical Refinement
AI assistance helped us fix minor mistakes and helps us with aligning our overall website to look more refined. It helped give us something to start from when it came to our color palette, we used the colors given as a base from which we found other colors that suited our aesthetic best and then found the relevant hexadecimals and RGB’s. We were able to build off a smooth scrolling feature with the help of AI and implement it in our JavaScript file.

Color Palette Development
The AI provided an initial pastel color scheme that served as our foundation. We then expanded on these suggestions by exploring complementary shades that better suited our brand aesthetic. Through iterative refinement, we sourced the precise hexadecimal values for our final color palette, creating a cohesive visual identity that maintains femininity while ensuring accessibility.

Feature Enhancement
Starting from basic AI suggestions, we evolved each feature through multiple iterations. The quiz functionality grew from a simple Q&A to include progress tracking, result matching, and community integration. The animated elements were refined to be more subtle and performance-optimized. Each component underwent continuous improvement based on both AI recommendations and our own design sensibilities.
